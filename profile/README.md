## Hey! Welcome to HytaleModding

We are a community that wants to support new and experienced mod developers to mod Hytale. We provide free resources, guides and documentation for Hytale. 

Transparency is a core value of HytaleModding, and we've open sourced **all** of our code on this organization. We also allow members from our community to showcase and host their code on our organization. 

### Get Involved

We'd love to have you involved in the community and contributing to the code, here are some repositories we're accepting contributions to:

- HytaleWebsite: https://github.com/HytaleModding/site
- Discord Bot: https://github.com/HytaleModding/robot

<!--
TBD:

- discord link
- banner
- translation contribution
