## Hey! Welcome to HytaleModding

We are a community that wants to support new and experienced mod developers to mod Hytale. We provide free resources, guides and documentation for Hytale. 

Transparency is a core value of HytaleModding, and we've open sourced **all** of our code on this organization. We also allow members from our community to showcase and host their code on our organization. 

You can join our discord with over 8,000 members: https://discord.gg/hytalemodding
